Trying to develop python programing skills in 100 day

##### This project uses tkinter module.

## Is Over Head Project

1. This project uses http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json api.
2. Project uses ISS Station data.
3. We get the data of sunrise and sunset times.
4. If the ISS close to my current position and it's currently dark, it's night time.
5. Then send me an email to tell me to look up.
6. That's all I want :)
